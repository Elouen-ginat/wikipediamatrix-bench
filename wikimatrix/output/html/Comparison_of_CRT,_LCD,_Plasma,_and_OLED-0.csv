When I asked how the contrast could be so high I was told that the surface is SO black the contrast is almost infinite. If the number representing the dark end of the contrast scale is nearly zero then dividing that number into the brightest value results in a very, very high contrast ratio.""[6] (1) Pixels can reset to black nearly instantaneously, so black levels remain consistently as black as they can be."

","The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.[52] Is the cheapest display technology currently produced, with some entry-level models selling for less than $100.","Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes.[53] New models are no longer produced.","Colored sub-pixels may age at different rates, leading to a color shift. Sensitive to UV light from direct sunlight. Is considered the highest quality but also the most expensive display technology currently produced, with products rarely being available for less than $1200."
