"In both languages arrays of reference types are covariant. This means that a String[] array is assignable to variables of Object[], as String is a specialization of (assignable to) Object. In both languages, the arrays will perform a type check when inserting new values, because type safety would otherwise be compromised. This is in contrast to how generic collections have been implemented in both languages.","In both languages arrays of reference types are covariant.
