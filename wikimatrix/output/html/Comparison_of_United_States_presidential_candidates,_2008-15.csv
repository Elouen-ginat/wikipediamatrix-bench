"Baldwin has stated that the US's involvement in Iraq is clearly unconstitutional as well as unnecessary, and would begin safely withdrawing troops.[31]","Barr considers the invasion and occupation of Iraq to have been mistakes. American presence ""emboldens both insurgents and terrorists"", and has cost ""hundreds of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars."" He supports ""withdrawal without undue delay.""[91]","McKinney calls for the immediate and orderly withdrawal of all US troops and contracted personnel from Iraq and Afghanistan; she would dismantle US military bases in the area, and demand that US and other international corporations relinquish any claims to Iraqi oil or other resources.[92] She has consistently opposed funding for the war and the military budget.[93]","Nader opposes the US occupation of Iraq on the grounds that ""it's the occupation that is breeding the resistance.""[94] He supports a ""responsible, orderly withdrawal"" within six months.[94] Following withdrawal, he supports inclusion of an international peacekeeping force under UN auspices, promotion of Iraqi self-rule through independent elections, and the providing of humanitarian aid to stabilize the country.[95]"
